Ukrainian National Anthem

Neither Ukraine's glory nor freedom have died yet.
Fate, Ukrainian brothers, will smile at us yet
Our enemies will perish like dew in the sun.
We will reign, brothers, in our dear land

Chorus:
We will give body and soul for our freedom
And show that we, brothers, are a Cossack family

We will stand, brothers, in bloody battle from the Syan to the Don.
We will not allow anyone else to rule in our homeland.
The Black Sea will yet smile, grandfather Dnipro will rejoice.
Destiny will yet come to fruition in our Ukraine!

Chorus
Enthusiasm and sincere work will yet give good account of itself.
This freedom's loud song will yet resound in Ukraine.
It will echo off the Carpathians and start to sound out across the steppes.
Ukraine's fame will become international
